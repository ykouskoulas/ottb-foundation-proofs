## Documentation

Main lemmas provided as html in doc/ folder for users who don't
want to install Coq and don't need to machine-check proofs
themselves.

## Dependencies

These proofs formalizing horizontal one-turn-to-bearing motion were
developed with the Coq proof assistant and the Coquelicot real
library.

One reliable way to get set up to check these proofs is to use the
opam package manager.

First use the package manager on your system to install opam, e.g.

$ sudo apt-get install opam

In some environments (e.g. if opam is already on your system)
it might be necessary to 

$ opam init

$ opam init env

Then you can install coq and coquelicot, letting opam handle
dependencies:

$ opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released

$ opam install coq

$ opam install coq-coquelicot

## To check the proofs
